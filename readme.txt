Enables Jetpack's Offline Mode, to use some modules without having a WordPress.com account.

== Description ==

With Offline Mode, features that do not require a connection to WordPress.com servers can be activated.

This plugin is using the jetpack_offline_mode filter to enable the Offline Mode. If you are familiar with ftp and file edit, you can also add the `define( 'JETPACK_DEV_DEBUG', true);` to the wp-config.php file. Make sure you add it before the `/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */` line.

This plugin also checks if the Jetpack plugin is already activated, so it is safe to use this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `surbma-jetpack-development-mode` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Surbma | Jetpack Offline Mode plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it. :)
